# RaspCGames

This project is a collection of games running on a custom made **Raspberry** configuration available from the linked IUT course.

> **Note:** The RaspberryPi not being available to copy or outside of the IUT, I made a Emulator creating a fictive WiringPi library displaying the LED and taking button input with a keyboard

# Examples of this work

Here you can see some recorded video about the emulator in console :
